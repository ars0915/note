- # SSRC Mismatch
	- SSRC stands for Synchronization Source Identifier in RTP streams.
	  â€¢	Every RTP stream (audio/video) is assigned a unique 32-bit SSRC.
	  â€¢	Itâ€™s used by rtpbin and rtpsession to distinguish different streamsâ€”especially when multiple are coming through the same source.
	- ðŸ”º SSRC Mismatch Happens When:
	  â€¢	You expect a certain stream with SSRC X, but receive SSRC Y.
	  â€¢	You pre-link to recv_rtp_sink_0 and expect it to always get stream A, but the SSRC in the packet changes.
	- ðŸ“Œ Consequence:
	  GStreamer might:
	  â€¢	Not bind the stream to the correct pad.
	  â€¢	Not trigger pad-added signal (because pad name is based on SSRC).
	  â€¢	Drop or ignore incoming data.
	- âœ… Best Practice: Use pad-added callback to dynamically link recv_rtp_src_0_*_* as they are created by rtpbin.
