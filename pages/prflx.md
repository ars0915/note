- # **Key Features of `prflx` (Peer Reflexive Candidates)**
	- **Dynamic Discovery:**
		- Unlike host, server reflexive (`srflx`), or relay candidates, a `prflx` candidate is not provided by the signaling process or STUN/TURN servers. It is discovered during the ICE connectivity checks when one peer sends a binding request to the other.
	- **Observed Address:**
		- A `prflx` candidate reflects the public-facing IP and port of a peer as seen by the other peer during the ICE process.
		- It typically occurs when NAT devices alter the source address and port of outgoing packets, and the receiving peer observes a different address/port combination than what was advertised in the host candidate.
	- **Higher Priority:**
		- Once discovered, a `prflx` candidate can take precedence over other candidates if it provides a better or more direct path for communication.
	- **Temporary Binding:**
		- These candidates are often transient and used only during the session. They don't require explicit signaling or external server interaction.
- # **How `prflx` Works**
	- **Initial Candidate Exchange:**
		- During ICE negotiation, each peer exchanges its gathered candidates (host, server reflexive, relay) through the signaling process.
	- **Connectivity Checks:**
		- Peers send ICE connectivity checks to each other. These are STUN binding requests sent over the network.
	- **Discovery:**
		- When a peer sends a binding request, the receiving peer may observe an unexpected source IP and port for the request (different from the advertised host or server reflexive candidate).
	- **Creation of `prflx`:**
		- The receiving peer generates a `prflx` candidate for the observed source address and port, associating it with the original host or server reflexive candidate.
	- **Pair Testing:**
		- The newly created `prflx` candidate is added to the list of potential candidate pairs for testing. If it works better than other candidates, it might be selected for the session.
