	- **Bitstream**
	  A bitstream is a sequence of binary data (bits) used to encode video or audio in a compressed format. It is essentially the output of an encoder and the input to a decoder. In video compression (e.g., H.264), the bitstream contains:
	  •	Encoded video data.
	  •	Metadata required to decode and display the video correctly.
	  The bitstream is structured in a way that allows efficient storage, transmission, and decoding while maintaining as much quality as possible within a given bitrate.
