	- ## Bitstream
	  A bitstream is a sequence of binary data (bits) used to encode video or audio in a compressed format. It is essentially the output of an encoder and the input to a decoder. In video compression (e.g., H.264), the bitstream contains:
	  •	Encoded video data.
	  •	Metadata required to decode and display the video correctly.
	  The bitstream is structured in a way that allows efficient storage, transmission, and decoding while maintaining as much quality as possible within a given bitrate.
		- ### Headers in the Bitstream?
		  In the context of video compression, headers are sections of the bitstream that contain metadata describing how the encoded video data is structured and how it should be decoded. Headers play a critical role in ensuring that a decoder can interpret the bitstream correctly.
